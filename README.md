Fine Tuning LLM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the steps:
Step1: Prepare the Data needed to Fine tune the LLM (We are using a Instruction Tuning Technique Here) - Here we are training the LLM to generate the LinkedIn Posts Just like I have written myself, using my style. For this we collect all my posts and added it to CSV Output Column and for each post I created a possible prompt (using GPT) and added that to the Input column:
 * Create a CSV file that has two columns (Input and the Output)
 * The Input column is a prompt that generates the post
 * The Output column is the actual post I have posted on LinkedIn
 * We translated the CSV file into a JSONL format
Step2: Fine Tune the model:
 * Open https://platform.openai.com/finetune/ftjob-0bccwfBJbaDF1agqBOE616Va?filter=all
 * Go To Fine-Tuning > Create >
   Provide Suffix
   Upload the jsonl file
 * Click Create Button
 * This will take some time to create the FineTuned LLM
Step3: Use the model to generate the pposts, compare the posts generated by the model and by the fine tuned model
